    1. Assignment done by: Georgios Pesmazoglou and Alexandru Ungureanu

    2. Help: We received helpful information and help from the TAs in Halligan

    3. Implementation: Based on the tests we've done, everything has been 
                       implemented correctly.
    
    4. Architecture: We used to following interfaces to implement the program:

            * compress40 - "controller" interface performing the main logic of
                           the program (compression and decompression)

            * compressed_io - interface responsible for reading and writing
                              compressed images

            * bitpack - interface responsible for extracting signed/unsigned 
                        integers from 64-bit words, and updating words by 
                        replacing sequences of bits with other sequences of 
                        bits corresponding to signed/unsigned integers

            * pixConversions - interface responsible for performing pixel
                               conversions (RGB - video,  lumas - cosine
                               coefficients)
 
            * floatIntScale - interface responsible for scaling floating-
                              point numbers to signed/unsigned integers
                              and unscaling signed/unsigned integers to
                              floating-point numbers

            The main function of the program (in 40image.c) handles the command
            line arguments and calls the appropriate compress/decompress 
            function from compress40. 

            The compress40 interface uses the public methods in pixConversions,
            compressed_io, pnm, floatIntScale, bitpack to compress/decompress. 
            It knows how to use those functions, but it doesn't know how the
            conversions, input-output methods and bit manipulation methods were
            implemented. pixConversions, compressed_io, floatIntScale, bitpack
            are independent modules and know nothing about each other.

            Interface "hierarchy":          
                                        pixConversion
            40image ->  compress40 ->  floatIntsScale
                                        compressed_io
                                           bitpack
