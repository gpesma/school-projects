 Trees
 Georgios Pesmazoglou


1) the purpose of the program is to implement a BST
and write basic functions one would use such as 
finding the minimum or removng an element

2) 
main.cpp creates instances of the tree class and 
performs opertions on them

BinarySearchTree.cp and BinarySearchTree.h are the implementation
and header files for the tree. Each tree node has pointers
for two children an integer vaue called data and a count of the
data. Overload assignment operator and copy constructor
functions are included

pretty print is used to print the trees

3) use Makefile to compile

4) The data structure is a typical binary search tree
inclusing count for nodes that include  specific data multiple
times. Recursive functions are used to transverse through
the tree and perform operations like adding nodes or finding
whether some value is included in the tree

5) The algorithm for all function was dicsussed in class
and is very common for BST. I used algorithm for node counting
functions that was found online
