We received life saving help from the wonderful Wesley Wei as well as
Charlie Meyer and a couple other TAs.

The function loadval takes up the most time.  It uses a push at the
beginning of the function, and then simply store the amounts we want to
shift the bits by, and then shift the bits left and shift the bits to the
right.  It is an extremely simply function, that simply takes the most time
because of the amount that it is called.  One way to make it slightly better
would be to not store the amount we have to shift the bits by in memory and
simply shift the amount of bytes by a certain value.  This would cut down
extra references to memory and make the code slightly faster.

We spent roughly 5 hours analyzing the problems and roughly 20-25 hours 
solving the problems after analysis.
